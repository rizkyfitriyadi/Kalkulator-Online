# 🧮 Simple Calculator Web App  

This is a simple **Python Calculator Web Application** that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**) with proper error handling (e.g., preventing division by zero and invalid inputs).  

✨ The app was created both as a **learning project** and as part of my **portfolio** to demonstrate my journey into the field of **Data Science**. Even though this project is simple, it reflects my ability to:  
- Write clean and structured Python code  
- Implement user input validation and exception handling  
- Build a web-based application for accessibility  
- Use GitHub to document and share projects as part of my professional portfolio

## 🚀 Features
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- Error handling for invalid inputs & division by zero  
- Web-based UI for easy access (no need to run locally)

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
As someone starting a career in **Data Science**, I believe showcasing projects—big or small—is important.  
This calculator app is my **first step** in building a portfolio that highlights my problem-solving mindset, technical learning progress, and ability to transform ideas into usable applications.  

This project marks the beginning of my portfolio journey before moving into **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning projects**.
